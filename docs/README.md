# Sourdough instructions

You're here because I've given you some sourdough starter! Now you need to know what to do with it.

The instructions below will sound complicated at first. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it after a few goes.

I should say that I'm generally a very unadventurous sourdough baker - I have one recipe that I use over and over again. I occasionally try new ones, but the loaf recipe I link to below fits into our lives much easier than anything more complicated.

That being said, I can recommend the following - tried, tested and very delicious:

- [Sourdough pizza crust](https://garturstitchfarm.com/blog/sourdough-pizza-crust)
- [Sourdough cinnamon rolls](https://garturstitchfarm.com/blog/kevins-sourdough-cinnamon-rolls) - I've also made these with orange/cranberry and chocolate fillings

## What you will need

- A big glass jar with lid (mine is 1l with a flip top lid)
- Good quality (preferably organic) rye flour
- Strong white bread flour
- Dough scraper (optional)
- Large cast iron pot (optional)
- Sharp knife, razor blade or lame

## What to do with your starter

### Put it in a big jar

When you take it home today, put it in a big glass jar. Needs to be glass so that you can see when your starter gets bubbly.

Make sure that the jar is big enough to accommodate the starter when it gets active and bubbly. I'd recommend that you use something big enough so that your starter occupies about 1/3 of the volume (I think the one I use is 1l). Make sure the opening is wide enough for you to give the contents a good mix.

Remove the rubber seal on the lid if your jar has one. Otherwise the gases that your starter generates when it is active will accumulate and this may cause a messy explosion in your fridge.

### Feed it

I've probably given you 200g of starter. If that is the case, add 110g water and 90g of dark rye flour. If it is not 200g, weigh it and then add the same proportion of water/flour to make the weight up to 400g. There is more information about feeding below.

**If you don't have everything you need to bake a loaf, you can put it in the fridge just now until you have everything. Just remember that you will have to feed it first when you do take it out the fridge to bake.**

### Start to monitor how active it is

Put a rubber band or something around the jar to mark the top of the starter. Over the next few (1-4) hours you should see the starter rise above the rubber band and start to develop bubbles. If you get bubbles forming, then your starter is active! If not, try discarding 200g of starter and feeding it again, as described in the previous section.

One you have bubbles, you are ready to bake.

## Making a loaf

I make between 1-3 sourdough loaves a week. I store my starter in the fridge between makes, this keeps it from getting too active.

To make a loaf, I do the following:
- take the starter out the fridge in the morning
- feed it
- wait until it has approximately doubled in size
- make the dough
- stretch and fold it a few times (more info below)
- shape it and store overnight in the fridge
- bake in the morning

If I want to have a loaf ready for Saturday morning, I start on Friday morning. This sounds a lot, but most of this time the dough is resting or in the fridge; hands on time is probably about 20-30 minutes once you get into a routine.

I use [Kat's Everyday Sourdough recipe on the Gartur Stitch blog](https://garturstitchfarm.com/blog/kats-basic-sourdough). The only change that I've made to this is that I use 15g of salt, rather than 20g. I sometimes add ~150g of another flour (e.g., rye or spelt)...more than that *may* work (I haven't tried) but my experience is that it starts to get a bit more dense at 150g.

I mix my dough in a big, wide, plastic salad bowl that I got from a supermarket. I use a plastic dough scraper ([like this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vogue-E401-Plain-Plastic-Scraper/dp/B00237UYDG/)) to [stretch and fold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc), but you can just use your hands (I just prefer to keep my hands clean). When putting it in the fridge, I line a ceramic baking bowl with a muslin cloth (a dish cloth will do), flour the cloth and then put the dough in. I use a razor blade to do the scoring (you will have to do some scoring to make sure that it will rise properly).

I bake mine inside a big cast iron pot, which does make quite a big difference to how well it rises.

## Feeding 

The starter needs to be fed regularly to keep it active.

To feed it:

1. remove ~200g of starter from your jar (you can either discard this or use it in other recipes, I've included some discard recipes below)
2. Add ~100g of water and mix thoroughly - really whip it up, the air is good for it
3. Add ~100g dark rye flour and mix well again

That's it!

RE the dark rye flour - I used to feed my starter with wholemeal flour, but I found that organic dark rye (not white rye!) is much better for getting it active and bubbly, which means you get a better rise in your loaf. Organic flour will contain more natural yeasts.

If you are baking once a week or more, you are probably OK to just feed it as I suggested above: in the morning before you bake. If you are going to skip a week, you may want to feed it in the fridge - you don't have to get it to room temperature for this, just take it out the fridge, feed it and then put it back in the fridge.

If your starter has a layer of liquid on it when you go to feed it, you can either mix it in or pour it off. It might be the alcohol byproduct of the yeast reaction...?

## Discard recipes

If you back regularly, it will start to feel a bit of a waste throwing out the starter, especially if you're using high quality organic rye flour.

There are loads of sourdough discard recipes out there, I've included some links below.

- [Gartur Stitch Farm discard recipes](https://garturstitchfarm.com/blog/category/Discard+Recipes)
- [King Arthur Flour discard recipes](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/collections/sourdough-discard-recipes)

This is an especially useful one, negligible faff and good for school lunch boxes.

## Going on holiday

I've kept my starter in the fridge for up to a month without using it. It might be a bit sleepy when you first go to use it, just feed it a couple of times before doing any baking to wake it up a bit.

You can freeze your starter if you're not going to use it for longer. I haven't done this, so you'd be better looking up advice elsewhere online about this.
