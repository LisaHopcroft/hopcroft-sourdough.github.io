# Sourdough instructions

You're here because I've given you some sourdough starter! Now you need to know what to do with it.

The instructions below will sound complicated at first. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it after a few goes.

I should say that I'm a very unadventurous sourdough baker - I have one recipe that I use over and over again. I occasionally try new ones, but the one I'm going to link to below fits into our lives much easier than anything more complicated.

## What you will need

- A big glass jar with lid (mine is 1l with a flip top lid)
- Good quality (preferably organic) rye flour
- Strong white bread flour
- Dough scraper (optional)
- Large cast iron pot (optional)
- Sharp knife, razor blade or lame

## What to do with your starter

### Put it in a big jar

When you take it home today, put it in a big glass jar. Needs to be glass so that you can see when your starter gets bubbly.

Make sure that the jar is big enough to accommodate the starter when it gets active and bubbly. I'd recommend that you use something big enough so that your starter occupies about 1/3 of the volume (I think the one I use is 1l). Make sure the opening is wide enough for you to give the contents a good mix.

Remove the rubber seal on the lid if your jar has one. Otherwise the gases that your starter generates when it is active will accumulate and this may cause a messy explosion in your fridge.

### Feed it

I've probably given you 200g of starter. If that is the case, add 110g water and 90g of dark rye flour. If it is not 2009, weigh it and then add the same proportion of water/flour to make the weight up to 400g. There is more information about feeding below.

**If you don't have everything you need to bake a loaf, you can put it in the fridge just now until you have everything.  Just remember that you will have to feed it first when you do take it out the fridge to bake.**

### Start to monitor how active it is

Put a rubber band or something around the jar to mark the top of the starter.  Over the next few (1-4) hours you should see the starter rise above the rubber band and start to develop bubbles.  If you get bubbles forming, then your starter is active!  If not, try discarding 200g of starter and feeding it again, as described in the previous section.

One you have bubbles, you are ready to bake.

## Making a loaf

I make between 1-3 sourdough loaves a week. I store my starter in the fridge between makes, this keeps it from getting too active.

To make a loaf, I do the following:
- take the starter out the fridge in the morning
- feed it
- wait until it has approximately doubled in size
- make the dough
- stretch and fold it a few times (more info below)
- shape it and store overnight in the fridge
- bake in the morning

If I want to have a loaf ready for Saturday morning, I start on Friday morning. This sounds a lot, but most of this time the dough is resting or in the fridge; hands on time is probably about 20-30 minutes once you get into a routine.

I use [Kat's Everyday Sourdough recipe on the Gartur Stitch blog](https://garturstitchfarm.com/blog/kats-basic-sourdough). The only change that I've made to this is that I use 15g of salt, rather than 20g.

I bake my inside a cast iron pot, which does make quite a big difference.  I sometimes add ~150g of another flour (e.g., rye or spelt)...more than that might work (I haven't tried), it starts to get a bit more dense at 150g.  The Gartur Stitch farm has lots of amazing recipes - cinnamon buns and pizza dough are both tried and tested and delicious!

I mix my dough in a big, wide, melamine salad bowl that I got from a supermarket.  I use a [plastic dough scraper]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vogue-E401-Plain-Plastic-Scraper/dp/B00237UYDG/), but you can just use your hands (I just like to keep mine clean so that I donâ€™t have to wash them as much).  When putting it in the fridge, I line a ceramic baking bowl with a muslin cloth (a dish cloth will do), flour the cloth and then put the dough in.  I use a razor blade to do the scoring (you will have to do some scoring to make sure that it will rise properly).

## Feeding 

The starter needs to be fed regularly to keep it active.

To feed it, remove ~200g of starter from your jar. You can either discard this or use it in other recipes (I've included some discard recipes below).

Add the water and mix thoroughly - really whip it up, the air is good for it. Then add the flour and mix well again.  I feed mine about 110g water and then 90g-ish organic rye flour. I've found that this ratio keeps the consistency about right (but the starter is very forgiving!). I used to feed it wholemeal flour, but I found that dark rye (not white rye!)is much better for getting it active and bubbly, which means you get a better rise in your loaf. Organic flour will contain more natural yeasts.

If you are baking once a week, you are probably OK to just feed it as I suggested above: in the morning before you bake.  If you are going to skip a week, you will want to feed it in the fridge - you don't have to warm it up for this, just take it out the fridge, feed it and then put it back in the fridge.

## Discard recipes

If you back regularly, it will start to feel a bit of a waste throwing out the starter, especially if you're using high quality organic rye flour.

There are loads of sourdough discard recipes out there, I've included some links below.

This is an especially useful one, negligible faff and good for school lunch boxes.

## Going on holiday

I've kept my starter in the fridge for up to a month without using it. It might be a bit sleepy when you first go to use it, just feed it a couple of times before doing any baking to wake it up a bit.

You can freeze your starter if you're not going to use it for longer. I haven't done this, so you'd be better looking up advice elsewhere online about this.
